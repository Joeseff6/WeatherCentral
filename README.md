## Project Description

The purpose of the deployed application is to test the user's knowledge in all things full stack (HTML, CSS, and Javascript). 

## What to Expect From the Application

A quiz will be given as a mini-game to the user, which will provide a series of questions relating to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each set of answers will have a question, that when an answer is clicked, will dynamically change to show the next set of questions. Once the game is over (either by answering all questions, or the timer runs out), the user will be taken to a highscore table in another web page. The user can then enter their initials and hit enter to save their score. They can also go back and play again after submitting initials.

### _** WARNING: In the game's current state, you must submit your initials before leaving the highscore page in order to properly save score.**_

## Tasks to Complete the Job :white_check_mark:
- [x] Provide buttons with functionality.
- [x] When user clicks on the start button, the button disappears and prompts the first question.
- [x] When an choice is clicked, a message will alert if the user is right or wrong.
- [x] If the choice is the correct answer, add one to point. If incorrect, deduct a second from the timer.
- [x] Provide user with a new question and repeat until either timer is up or all questions have been answered.
- [x] Once game is over, store score onto local storage.
- [x] Change window to a new page (highscore page) upon game's end.
- [x] Allow user to input initials which is saved into local storage
- [x] Render table with initials and score even when page is refreshed for persistence.
