## Project Description

The purpose of the deployed application is to provide a weather dashboard that the user can utilize for checking the weather in a requested city.

## What to Expect From the Application

A user can go into this web application and pull up a 5-day forecast of the weather in a requested city. Say for example, the user wants to see the estimated weather in Houston, Texas for the next 5 days, they can search by the location and pull up the current forecast. This application utilizes the server-side OpenWeather API to populate the application with weather data. A list of the user's previous search history will remain for ease of access.
